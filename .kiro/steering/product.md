# Product Overview

**Phosphor Decay Mobile** is a mobile-optimized audio-visual performance instrument that creates real-time feedback loops where video and audio continuously influence each other. It's a touch-enabled browser-based tool for VJs, experimental musicians, and live performers on mobile devices.

## Core Concept

The system operates on a tautological feedback principle: the canvas observes itself, creating analog video feedback (like pointing a camera at a TV), while audio responds to visual motion and brightness patterns. Users can add geometric shapes, draw patterns, and manipulate both visual and audio parameters in real-time.

## Key Features

- **Analog Video Feedback**: Canvas captures itself with transformations (zoom, rotation, pan) creating infinite recursive patterns
- **Visual-Driven Audio**: Motion detection and brightness analysis drive musical composition in real-time
- **Generative Music**: Chord progressions, rhythm patterns, and melody generation based on music theory
- **3D Sacred Geometry**: Rotating wireframe shapes (Merkaba, Metatron's Cube, polyhedra, spirals)
- **Drawing System**: Record, loop, and layer gestural drawings that become part of the feedback
- **Dual Sequencing Modes**: 
  - Time-based: Traditional rhythm scheduling with chord progressions
  - Visual-driven: Fractal motion patterns trigger notes
- **Live Performance**: Fullscreen mode, UI hiding, extensive real-time parameter control

## Mobile-Specific Features

- **Touch Gestures**: 1-finger pan, 2-finger pinch zoom, 2-finger rotate
- **Dropdown Controls**: All parameters accessible via slide-out menu (⋮ button)
- **Full-Screen Canvas**: Maximum visual space on mobile screens
- **Touch-Optimized UI**: Larger buttons and sliders for easy manipulation

## Target Users

- Mobile VJs and live visual performers
- Experimental musicians and sound artists on-the-go
- Anyone exploring recursive/feedback-based art on tablets/phones
- Live performance artists seeking portable audio-visual unity
